      For the better part of a decade, autonomous vehicle companies have been simultaneously working to develop safe technology, build public trust, and navigate regulation. However, companies have faced challenges in all three of these areas.<br><br>


          After starting its autonomous driving project in 2009, Alphabet (Google’s parent company) distinguished Waymo as an “independent self-driving technology company” in 2016. The following year, Waymo launched its early rider program in the Phoenix area with the mission of improving traffic safety.<br><br>
    
          In 2022 alone, The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/traffic-crash-death-estimates-2022" target="_blank" style="color: lightblue;"">estimated that</a> 42,795 people died in motor vehicle traffic crashes in the U.S. <a href="https://waymo.com/faq/" target="_blank" style="color: lightblue;"">According to Waymo</a>, 94% of these crashes involve “human error or choice.” <br><br>
    
    
          Waymo wasn’t the only company to notice these numbers.<br><br>
    
          Cruise (<a href="https://news.gm.com/newsroom.detail.html/Pages/news/us/en/2022/mar/0318-cruise.html#:~:text=DETROIT%20%E2%80%94%20Today%2C%20General%20Motors%20Co,by%20the%20fund%20in%202018." target="_blank" style="color: lightblue;"">GM</a>) and Zoox (<a href="https://zoox.com/about?modal=timeline&stage=2020" target="_blank" style="color: lightblue;"">Amazon</a>), the two other major players in the Bay Area self-driving vehicle market, have been around since 2013 and 2014 respectively. Smaller autonomous driving companies like Motional and Aurora have also joined the industry in the last few years. <br><br>
    
          Waymo is the only company to offer fully-autonomous robo taxi rides to the San Francisco public, but they weren’t always alone. Cruise was also offering rides to the public before a major accident last year.

      Crashes and clashes

    <p>
      On October 2, 2023, disaster struck in San Francisco.<br><br>

      According to an <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/95kuvdv8zn1v/1mb55pLYkkXVn0nXxEXz7w/9fb0e4938a89dc5cc09bf39e86ce5b9c/2024.01.24_Quinn_Emanuel_Report_re_Cruise.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: lightblue;"">independent investigation</a>, a driver in a non-autonomous vehicle hit a pedestrian at the intersection of 5th and Market Street. As it was pulling away from the incident, a Cruise vehicle pinned the pedestrian under one of its tires and dragged her about 20 feet before stopping. She suffered critical injuries.<br><br>

      The incident prompted Cruise to cut its active fleet in half immediately. Shortly after, the California DMV <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/news-and-media/dmv-statement-on-cruise-llc-suspension/" target="_blank" style="color: lightblue;"">suspended Cruise’s permits</a> to operate driverless cars across the state,
      citing an <a href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/driverless-cars-traffic-tickets-california-transportation-laws/3379154/" target="_blank" style="color: lightblue;"">“unreasonable risk to public safety.”</a> According to <a href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/investigations/cruise-closecall-crosswalk-safety-allegations/3444410/" target="_blank" style="color: lightblue;"">NBC Bay Area</a>, Cruise is under at least five independent investigations for its safety record and accusations of misleading the public.<br><br>

      On social media, the public slammed Cruise for the incident. Waymo and Zoox have also come under close scrutiny following the collision.

    But the criticism didn’t stop there. Critics also pointed to examples of self-driving cars <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/dashcam-footage-shows-driverless-cars-cruise-waymo-clogging-san-francisco/" target="_blank" style="color: lightblue;"">obstructing</a> emergency vehicles, city buses and general traffic as reasons for their frustrations.<br><br>

      AV companies respond

    <p>
      Some say that the investigation following the burning puts Waymo in the victim spotlight, an impact that would run counter to autonomous vehicle opposition.<br><br>

      In an 
      <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2024/02/16/san-francisco-waymo-arson-investigation-sfpd/" target="_blank" style="color: lightblue;"">SF Standard article</a>
      about the aftermath of the arson, crisis management consultant Sam Singer suggested that the burning could be an opportunity for Waymo to “generate understanding and sympathy for technology companies.”<br><br>

      San Francisco-based culture writer and critic Theodore Gioia recounted his experiences with Cruise and Waymo in a 
      <a href="https://www.curbed.com/article/waymo-cruise-driverless-cars-robotaxi-san-francisco.html" target="_blank" style="color: lightblue;"">feature piece for Curbed</a>

      Despite the backlash and preparations for outroar, autonomous vehicle companies still have enthusiastic riders to address.<br><br>

      Nathaniel Nyberg, a software engineer at Zoox, said he believes the demand for autonomous rides exceeds the supply of vehicles available — which is a good sign, he said.<br><br>

      “The problem is getting into the vehicle,” he said. “Once you’re in, it’s no longer a concern.”<br><br>

      Joel Johnson, Youtuber and former participant in Waymo’s early rider testing program, said that seeing the technology inside the car was a game-changer for him. <br><br>

      “Part of the confidence loop comes back to the rider’s screen that shows what the car sees in real time,” Johnson said in an interview. “That is a huge part of why I trust these vehicles.”

    <h2>
      Nothing new in tech
    </h2>
    <p>
      Waymo’s struggle is nothing new in the eyes of the tech startup industry. <br><br>

      In recent years, media outlets have painted Silicon Valley in a negative light, pointing out 
      <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-11-11/ftx-adam-neumann-mark-zuckerberg-and-the-cult-of-the-founder?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" style="color: lightblue;"">“destructive” founder worship</a>
      and 
      <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/the-marvellous-boys-of-palo-alto" target="_blank" style="color: lightblue;"">scandals that are rooted in “innovation and impunity.”</a>
      Prominent tech figures formerly praised for their transformative and society-altering ideas are now rapidly losing their trust and support following the crash of Sam Bankman-Fried’s Silicon Valley Bank and controversies behind Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta.  <br><br>

      “In general, the tech sector has not done a good job creating narratives for technology outside of the startups and fraud,” Gioia said. “Those are the two dominant cultural narratives, people like Mark Zuckerberg or Sam Bankman-Fried.”<br><br>

      In fact, stark similarities can even be seen with one of Waymo’s competitors, Uber. 
      <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/111015/story-uber.asp#:~:text=black%20car%20service.-,From%202015%20to%20Today,Saudi%20Arabia's%20sovereign%20wealth%20fund." target="_blank" style="color: lightblue;"">In July of 2015</a>
      , Uber took the world by storm, becoming the world’s most valuable startup at $51 billion.<br><br>

      Uber’s stardom led to an abundance of controversy. People became

      The diffusion of innovations curve, a theory developed by Everett Rogers in 1962, splits the general population into five groups based on how they accept new technologies: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority and laggards. People who are eager to try a Waymo ride would be classified as innovators, which means they make up less than 3% of the population.

      Uber went through the same path of public adoption, and now Waymo faces similar struggles.<br><br>

      In addition to facing widespread social criticism, Waymo must also contend with significant legal challenges moving forward.<br><br>

      The road ahead

    <p>
      No one is willing to give a definitive answer on where they see the industry in the near future. These companies are highly protective of where and when they plan to expand, but it’s also likely that no one really knows what is possible. <br><br>

      Some believe that the technology is not the concern, rather the perception of it is.<br><br>
      
      <div style="text-align: center">
        <img src="Popup5.jpeg" alt="Popup5" id="dynamic-image" style="width: 70%; height: auto">

      Dishi Li, a senior product manager at Lucid, says the government will need to take responsibility because “companies will try to do the most they can to expand.” <br><br>

      What that oversight looks like, however, is also unknown. <br><br>

      Some legislators have introduced bills that would regulate the autonomous vehicle industry. For example, California senate bill 
      <a href="https://sd15.senate.ca.gov/news/bill-senator-cortese-empowers-local-communities-steer-driverless-car-safety" target="_blank" style="color: lightblue;"">915</a>
      would allow cities and local governments, not just state regulators, to control permits for autonomous vehicle companies.<br><br>

      Local special interest groups and unions support this kind of legislation. <br><br>

      “SB 915 is the common-sense measure to ensure autonomous vehicles don't operate in a regulatory vacuum, putting lives at risk,” Peter Finn, Teamsters’ Western Region International VP said in a 
      <a href="https://sd15.senate.ca.gov/news/bill-senator-cortese-empowers-local-communities-steer-driverless-car-safety#:~:text=%E2%80%9CSB%20915%20is%20the%20common,vehicles%20operate%20on%20their%20streets.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" style="color: lightblue;"">public statement</a>
      . <br><br>

      “The public wants their municipal officials to be the decision makers when it comes to AVs,” Matthew McQuaid, Teamsters’ Communications Project Manager, said. “It’s fundamentally a pro-democracy bill.” <br><br>

      Along with groups like the Truck Safety Coalition, the Teamsters’ have been working with elected officials and regulatory agencies to push specific regulation over AV operations into government policy.<br><br>

      “During our fight to get AB 316 passed, so many local leaders and California residents were shocked to find out for the first time they were powerless to stop AVs from coming into their communities,” McQuaid said.<br><br>

      <a href="https://sd15.senate.ca.gov/news/bill-senator-cortese-empowers-local-communities-steer-driverless-car-safety" target="_blank" style="color: lightblue;"">AB 2286</a>
      , which would have required human operators at the wheel of self-driving trucks over 10,000 pounds, was an inspiration for similar qualifications to be made for robotaxis. Though 90% of the legislature 
      <a href="https://www.ccjdigital.com/regulations/article/15664118/teamsters-california-lawmakers-reintroduce-push-for-bill-to-require-human-operators-in-av-trucks#:~:text=Authored%20by%20Assemblymember%20Cecilia%20Aguiar,transporting%20goods%2C%20or%20transporting%20passengers." target="_blank" style="color: lightblue;"">was in favor of the bill</a>
      , Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed it in September. <br><br>

      Inspired by AB 2286, one of the Teamsters’ main goals outlined in its 
      <a href="https://teamster.org/2023/09/teamsters-autonomous-vehicle-federal-policy-principles/" target="_blank" style="color: lightblue;"">AV Federal Policy Framework</a>
      is to mandate human drivers in all commercial AVs, including robotaxis like Waymo’s. <br><br>

      Existing regulation is favorable to the industry because some lawmakers take AV companies’ word when it comes to safety records, McQuaid explained.<br><br>

      “In 2023, AVs wreaked havoc on public roads by sending pedestrians to the hospital, causing traffic pile-ups and preventing first responders from doing their jobs,” McQuaid said. “These vehicles are nowhere remotely close to having the same capabilities that a human operator has.”<br><br>

      Despite the uncertainty surrounding safety records and expansion, Johnson is optimistic about the future of self-driving technology. He mentioned potential benefits like sleeping on the way to work and not needing to own a car at all.<br><br>

      “If the companies can keep up their promises of how safe these cars are, there’s really cool opportunities to reduce traffic fatalities and incidents almost to zero.”
