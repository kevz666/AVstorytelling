      For the better part of a decade, autonomous vehicle companies have been simultaneously working to develop safe technology, build public trust, and navigate regulation. However, companies have faced challenges in all three of these areas.<br><br>


      After starting its autonomous driving project in 2009, Alphabet (Google’s parent company) distinguished Waymo as an “independent self-driving technology company” in 2016. The following year, Waymo launched its early rider program in the Phoenix area with the mission of improving traffic safety.<br><br>
      
      In 2022 alone, The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/traffic-crash-death-estimates-2022" style="color: lightblue;"">estimated that</a> 42,795 people died in motor vehicle traffic crashes in the U.S. <a href="https://waymo.com/faq/" style="color: lightblue;"">According to Waymo</a>, 94% of these crashes involve “human error or choice.” <br><br>
      
      
      Waymo wasn’t the only company to notice these numbers.<br><br>
      
      Cruise (<a href="https://news.gm.com/newsroom.detail.html/Pages/news/us/en/2022/mar/0318-cruise.html#:~:text=DETROIT%20%E2%80%94%20Today%2C%20General%20Motors%20Co,by%20the%20fund%20in%202018." style="color: lightblue;"">GM</a>) and Zoox (<a href="https://zoox.com/about?modal=timeline&stage=2020" style="color: lightblue;"">Amazon</a>), the two other major players in the Bay Area self-driving vehicle market, have been around since 2013 and 2014 respectively. Smaller autonomous driving companies like Motional and Aurora have also joined the industry in the last few years. <br><br>
      
      Waymo is the only company to offer fully-autonomous robo taxi rides to the San Francisco public, but they weren’t always alone. Cruise was also offering rides to the public before a major accident last year.
