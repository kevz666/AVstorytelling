            We are going to include pictures and video clips from our ride 
            in a Waymo in the beginning of the website. At each clip, we're
            planning on adding an interactive action for the user to choose
            that will continue the scrolly story.

    <h1>Through the Eyes of Autonomous Vehicles</h1>
        <p>
          For the better part of a decade, autonomous vehicle companies have been simultaneously working to develop safe technology, build public trust, and navigate regulation. However, companies have faced challenges in all three of these areas.<br>


          After starting its autonomous driving project in 2009, Alphabet (Google’s parent company) distinguished Waymo as an “independent self-driving technology company” in 2016. The following year, Waymo launched its early rider program in the Phoenix area with the mission of improving traffic safety.
          
          In 2022 alone, The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimated that 42,795 people died in motor vehicle traffic crashes in the U.S. According to Waymo, 94% of these crashes involve “human error or choice.” 
          
          
          Waymo wasn’t the only company to notice these numbers.
          
          Cruise (GM) and Zoox (Amazon), the two other major players in the Bay Area self-driving vehicle market, have been around since 2013 and 2014 respectively. Smaller autonomous driving companies like Motional and Aurora have also joined the industry in the last few years. 
          
          Waymo is the only company to offer fully-autonomous robo taxi rides to the San Francisco public, but they weren’t always alone. Cruise was also offering rides to the public before a major accident last year.
